What are the issues with the Current design, if any? Why? or Why not?

  1. There are no issues with this design because it contains all of the buttons that are needed.
  
Why does the design have no issues with it? 

  1. All buttons of the elevator interface are properly listed and positioned.
  2. It supports people with disabilities because contains braille next to every single button inside the elevator.
  3. There are signs and buttons for emergency.

The purposes of using elevators? (Common Uses)

  1. Allows people to move and takes things from one floor to another floor of a building.
  2. It contains buttons that perform important tasks such as the help button, it allows the people in the elevator to get in touch with security personnel.
  3. People with disabilities can easily utilize them.
  
The purposes of using elevators? (Rare Uses)

  1. Emergency buttons such as help and alarm are used the least amount of times.
  2. I have not seen or used an elevator that is touchscreen.
  
The interface that I created, does it make it easier to do these common things?

  1. No, it does not make these easier to do because my interface is very similar to the original elevator design.

Common sequence of actions? (Human Elevator interaction)

  1. User(s) presses the button on their floor to call the elevator to that same floor.
  2. After the elevator reaches the floor then the user(s) get in and click the floor button they want to go.
  3. Next, if the elevator door takes too long to close then the user(s) can use the close door button.
  4. Finally, the elevator closes and proceeds to the selected floor(s) then the user(s) leave the elevator.
  
How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?
 
  1. Elevator buttons light up after a button is selected/pressed.

How does the elevator provide feedback to the user? 

  1. The selected/pressed floor button lights up.
  2. The elevator makes a sound when the selected floor is reached right before the doors open.
  3. Users can feel the elevator moving up or down.
  4. The screen in the elevators lets users know what floor(s) they just passed and which direction is in the elevator moving/going in.

What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?

  1. No mistakes can be made with this current design because everything that is needed in an elevator is already provided.
